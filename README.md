Yes, you're on the right track! Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Margin Calculation in Forex Trading
In a currency pair like USD/TRY, USD is the base currency and TRY is the quote currency.
When you place a trade, you are effectively buying or selling the base currency using the quote currency.

The margin required for a trade is typically calculated based on the value of the base currency.
For example, if you want to trade 1,000 units of USD/TRY, the margin required will be a percentage of the value of 1,000 USD in TRY.


When you buy USD/TRY, you are buying USD and selling TRY.
Conversely, when you sell USD/TRY, you are selling USD and buying TRY.

Example Calculation
Let's say the exchange rate for USD/TRY is 34. If you want to buy 1,000 USD:

The value of 1,000 USD in TRY is ( 1,000 \times 34 = 34,000 ) TRY.

If your broker requires a 2% margin, the margin required would be ( 34,000 \times 0.02 = 680 ) TRY.

Key Points
The amount of money required to open a position, calculated based on the value of the base currency.

Allows you to control a larger position with a smaller amount of money. For example, with 50:1 leverage, you can control $50,000 with $1,000.
The bid price is what you can sell the base currency for, and the ask price is what you can buy the base currency for.

CHFCAD still makes it 0.20 as exchange rate is 1.60 which is not value and looking at all makes it one way but bought a bit DKK and JPY of course by paying
2:11 PM
Seems like, because of telemetrics by blackbull or whole planet are selling and buying USDTRY for 2 dollars. Weird USDTRY has telemetrics at it's exchange rate as value and the volumetrics are not cutting out while USDHKD has quite same volumetrics, but telemetrics are half off as value with exchange rate for same 2 dollars.
2:53 PM
CHFCAD still just makes it 0.20 value at average point exchange rate 4 and if we look at all bought JPY, DKK of course by paying meanwhile everyone else invested in CHF and it's going for a fall nothing politically in calendar, but SGD has somethings prepared CHF like a autumn yes so it's going to buy TRY or SGD. Nope CHF buys to pay too much to it's neighbors and even Mexicans and GBP, USD, CAD kill values.

Best website for economic calendar that has CHN, TRY, HKD, SGD with importance and consensus, previous and forecast.

So in reverse vice versa the more paid JPY the higher currency the others paid for the better for that higher currency to pay JPY

4:50 PM
When market has no news we just follow statistics, values, volume, telemetric. The bigger currency is paying more to buy smaller. So best forex investment is USDCAD.
4:58 PM
Oh forgot is less in exchange to more from less. Mistaken SGD, HKD, TRY, CHN for high.
2:45 AM
So we look how much same base currency buys which quota currencies not really by value, so JPY is a lot more if GBP buys it by fall in GBPJPY, making GBP much stronger. Saying that if your pair is out of combat of USD, GBP, CAD, -EUR when they are falling/buying, paying or rising/paying, buying as base currencies other currencies which is a bid for our pair if not enough base currencies bought, paid the quota currency by falling then by highest valuable different base currency you are good to bid. If it's rising/paying, buying you are good to ask, but the quota currency with out of combat base currency if quota currency has been falling/buying, paying enough valuable other currencies as base currency. Example JPY does not have much base, but still does. Economic calendar does not have to point out both pairs against each other, but has to match or we can just do that if economic calendar shows nothing that's sentiment
4:40 AM
The lowest point USDCAD was 1.0000. The highest point NOKSEK was 1.3000. The highest point AUDJPY 110.0000. The lowest point GBPSEK 10.0000. Lowest fall to zero and highest reach 100% gain. Only reason. Drops out in order. Other do not matter. 
6:49 AM
So if most valuable known GBP falls it should buy, pay fall for lowest valuable currencies. No swapping. The telemetric should release from between values in exchange rate to the most open in telemetric. The volumes do not matter it's all 0-100%. Like I've know it's up and news show down you sell it. Never did.
